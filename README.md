# Machine-Learning-Final-Project

Final Project for Machine Learning Course.

The goal of this assignment is to perform machine learning algorithms on the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset to determine which algorithm is best to use to
tell whether a credit card is fraudulent or not and the Energy Efficiency dataset to predict which values of data specific to energy efficiency would provide
the best values for heating and cooling loads.
